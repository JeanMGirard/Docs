# Patterns

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
* [Constructor](/creational-constructor.md) - A constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object.
* [Factory Method](/creational-factory-method.md) - This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.
* [Abstract Factory](/creational-abstract-factory.md) - Creates an instance of several families of classes without detailing concrete classes.
* [Builder](/creational-builder.md) - Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same type of object.
* [Prototype](/creational-prototype.md) - A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning
* [Singleton](/creational-singleton.md) - A class with only a single instance with global access points

### Structural Patterns
* [Adapter](/structural-adapter.md) - Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces.
* [Bridge](/structural-bridge.md) - Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
* [Composite](/structural-composite.md) - A structure of simple and composite objects which makes the total object more than just the sum of its parts.
* [Decorator](/structural-decorator.md) - Dynamically add alternate processing to objects.
* [Facade](/structural-facade.md) - A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.
* [Flyweight](/structural-flyweight.md) - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that is contained elsewhere.
* [Proxy](/structural-proxy.md) - A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.

### Behavioral Patterns
* [Interpreter](/behavioral-interpreter.md) - A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language.
* [Template Method](/behavioral-template-method.md) - Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defer the exact steps to a subclass.
* [Chain of Responsibility](/behavioral-chain-of-responsibility.md) - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request.
* [Command](/behavioral-command.md) - Encapsulate a command request as an object to enable, logging
and/or queuing of requests, and provides error-handling for unhandled requests.
* [Iterator](/behavioral-iterator.md) - Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection.
* [Mediator](/behavioral-mediator.md) - Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.
* [Memento](/behavioral-memento.md) - Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.
* [Observer](/behavioral-observer.md) - A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.
* [State](/behavioral-state.md) - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
* [Strategy](/behavioral-strategy.md) - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation.
* [Visitor](/behavioral-visitor.md) - Adds a new operation to a class without changing the class.

### Other Patterns
* [Module](/others-module.md) - Modules are an integral piece of any robust application's architecture and typically help in keeping the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized.
* [Revealing Module](/others-revealing-module.md) - An updated module pattern where we would simply define all of our functions and variables in the private scope and return an anonymous object with pointers to the private functionality we wished to reveal as public.
* [Mixin](/others-mixins.md) - Mixins are classes which offer functionality that can be easily inherited by a sub-class or group of sub-classes for the purpose of
